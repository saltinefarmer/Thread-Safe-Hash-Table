# Thread Safe Hash Table

## What this Project is
This Hash Table was an assignment from my operating systems course. This assignment was designed to draw upon existing fundamental skills, and add a layer of complexity to pose a challenge. The assignment highlighted the ability to create and manage unknown quantites of threads to accomplish a single goal. To complete this assignment, we had to display the ability to understand complex concepts, code the concepts, and debug them when a race condition or deadlock invariably arose.

## Involved Parties
I designed and executed the files main.c and ts_hashmap.c in accordance to requirements set by Dr. David Chiu. The supporting files that remain were provided by Dr. Chiu.

## References
The textbook used in this class is Operating System Concepts (10th Edition) by Abraham Silberschatz.

## Instructions
This code must be run on a machine that can compile and run the C language. It requires the following files:
- limits.h
- pthread.h
- stdlib.h
- stdio.h
- string.h
